Quiz-App Microservice Architecture
Introduction
The Quiz-App is a microservice-based architecture that consists of multiple services designed to handle different aspects of the quiz application. It is built using Spring Boot and incorporates Eureka Server for service discovery, OpenFeign for communication between services, and an API Gateway for centralized routing.

Architecture Overview
The Quiz-App architecture is based on microservices, where each service is responsible for a specific domain or functionality. The key components of the architecture include:

Eureka Server: The service registry that allows microservices to discover and communicate with each other.

Quiz Service: A microservice that handles quiz-related operations, such as creating quizzes, managing questions, and evaluating quiz results.

Question Service: A microservice responsible for managing question-related operations, including adding new questions, retrieving question details, and maintaining question categories.

API Gateway: The centralized entry point for all client requests. It acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests to the appropriate microservices.

Services Description
1. Eureka Server
Endpoint: http://eureka-server:8761/
Description: The Eureka Server provides a registry of all microservices in the system, allowing each service to discover and communicate with others.
2. Quiz Service
Endpoint: http://quiz-service:8081/
Description: The Quiz Service manages quiz-related functionalities. It exposes REST APIs for creating quizzes, managing questions, and evaluating quiz results.
3. Question Service
Endpoint: http://question-service:8082/
Description: The Question Service handles question-related operations. It provides APIs for adding new questions, retrieving question details, and managing question categories.
4. API Gateway
Endpoint: http://api-gateway:8765/
Description: The API Gateway serves as a single entry point for all client requests. It routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservices and handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and monitoring.
Prerequisites
Before running the Quiz-App, ensure the following are installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
Apache Maven
Docker (optional, for containerization)
Setup
Follow the steps below to set up and run the Quiz-App:

Clone the repository from GitHub URL.

Navigate to the project directory and build the services using Maven:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the Eureka Server:

bash
Copy code
java -jar eureka-server/target/eureka-server.jar
Run the Quiz Service:

bash
Copy code
java -jar quiz-service/target/quiz-service.jar
Run the Question Service:

bash
Copy code
java -jar question-service/target/question-service.jar
Run the API Gateway:

bash
Copy code
java -jar api-gateway/target/api-gateway.jar
Usage
Once the services are up and running, you can access the Quiz-App through the API Gateway endpoint: http://api-gateway:8765/

For detailed API documentation, you can refer to the OpenAPI/Swagger documentation available at http://api-gateway:8765/swagger-ui.html

Additional Notes
Make sure to configure the database connections and other environment-specific properties in the respective service's application.yml or application.properties file.

Consider implementing security measures like authentication and authorization for production deployments.
